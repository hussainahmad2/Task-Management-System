Good — now you’re getting specific, which is exactly what this needs.
I’ll lock this down into a clean, enterprise-grade design that covers:

C-level → interns

Senior / Junior hierarchy

Task system like ClickUp

Graphs, charts, analytics

Everything structured so it can actually scale

No theory. This is implementation-ready.

🏢 ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY (FULLY FLEXIBLE)
Core Roles (Top → Bottom)
Level	Role
L1	CEO
L2	CPO
L2	CTO
L2	CIO
L3	General Manager
L4	HR Manager
L4	Finance Manager
L5	Assistant Manager
L6	Senior Employee
L7	Junior Employee
L8	Intern

⚠️ Important:
These are NOT hardcoded roles.
They are designations + permissions (RBAC).

How hierarchy actually works (CRITICAL)

Instead of fixed roles:

designation → title (CEO, Intern, etc.)

reports_to → another employee

level → numeric hierarchy (1–10)

This allows:

Multiple CEOs (group companies)

Flat or deep orgs

Future changes without code rewrite
